# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions:
**Q: Why doesn't the application open?**  
**R:** It's possible that you may have deleted some files. To ensure the application works correctly, both "CConverter.jar" and "Updater.jar" should be in the same folder.  
**Q: Why doesn't the offline mode perform conversions?**  
**R:** The application requires an internet connection to update the latest conversion rates. If it's your first time using the application, there won't be any saved values for offline conversions.  
**Q: What is the app.properties file that appears when the application is launched for the first time?**  
**R:** It is a file where conversion values are stored. If you delete it, it will reappear, but the saved values will be lost.
