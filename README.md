# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions:
**Q: Why doesn't the application update automatically to the latest version anymore?**

<br><br>
**Q: Why doesn't the offline mode perform conversions?**  
**R:** The application requires an internet connection to update the latest conversion rates. If it's your first time using the application, there won't be any saved values for offline conversions.
